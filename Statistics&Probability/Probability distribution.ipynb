    "A probability Distribution represents the predicted outcomes of various values for a given data. Probability distributions occur in a variety of forms and sizes, each with its own set of characteristics such as mean, median, mode, skewness, standard deviation, kurtosis, etc. Probability distributions are of various types let’s demonstrate how to find them in this article.
